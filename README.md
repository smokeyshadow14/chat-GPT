# Thaeshian Wheel Repository

This repository organizes materials for the **Thaeshian** project in a wheel-shaped partition. Each `disc` folder corresponds to a **Disc** of the Wheel, and each `ring` subfolder corresponds to the ring values for that disc. The wheel (κύκλος — *kyklos* in Greek, **hvel** in Old Norse) is central to Thaeshia’s cosmology; the **Eye** (ὀφθαλμός — *ophthalmos*; **auga** in Old Norse) sits at Disc 0, Tile 1.

## Directory Structure

- `disc0/center` — The Eye (center tile).
- `disc1/ring2` — Two tiles.
- `disc2/ring4` and `disc2/ring8` — Four and eight tiles.
- `disc3/ring3`, `disc3/ring9`, `disc3/ring18` — Three, nine and eighteen tiles.
- `disc4/ring4`, `disc4/ring8`, `disc4/ring16`, `disc4/ring32` — Four, eight, sixteen, and thirty-two tiles.
- `disc5/ring5`, `disc5/ring10`, `disc5/ring15`, `disc5/ring25`, `disc5/ring50` — Five, ten, fifteen, twenty‑five, and fifty tiles.
- `disc6/ring3`, `disc6/ring6`, `disc6/ring12`, `disc6/ring24`, `disc6/ring36`, `disc6/ring72` — Three, six, twelve, twenty‑four, thirty‑six, and seventy‑two tiles.

Each folder acts as a container for files relating to its ring. For example, `disc3/ring9` would hold content aligned to the nine‑tile ring of Disc 3, such as runic threads, minor arcana correspondences, or harmonic matrices.

## Files

- `wheel_schema.json` — JSON data capturing the ring sizes for each disc. This schema can be used by scripts (e.g., the mini engine) to reconstruct the Wheel’s structure programmatically.
- Additional documents, lore, and scripts should be placed in the appropriate disc/ring folders.

## Usage & Synchronization

This repository serves as a central anchor for synchronizing your connected apps (Notion, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, Canva). Use this structure to map items across your tools:

- **Notion**: Create a database where each entry corresponds to a tile, referencing the files in these folders.
- **Google Drive**: Mirror this folder structure on Drive to store larger files (videos, PDFs) and link them back to Notion.
- **Gmail**: Tag or label emails according to discs/rings when archiving information from collaborators.
- **Google Calendar**: Schedule rituals or recurring tasks based on the ring counts (e.g., 18‑day cycles) and link them to relevant tiles.
- **Canva**: Design visual aids (sigils, charts) for each disc/ring and save them into this structure.

By partitioning your data according to the Wheel, you maintain harmonic alignment across all mediums. This approach reflects the **fractal logic** of the Wheel, respecting the hierarchy of discs and rings and allowing recursive reasoning (as taught in the CTMU and Thaeshia’s own cosmology).
